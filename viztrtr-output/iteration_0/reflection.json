  "reasoning": "This iteration revealed a critical disconnect - we planned 5 changes but implemented 0 files, yet somehow achieved a +1.0 score improvement. This is highly suspicious and suggests either a scoring anomaly or a system error. Since no actual changes were made, there's nothing to rollback, but we clearly need to ensure the implementation pipeline is functioning correctly. The design recommendations (accessibility improvements like contrast and focus indicators) are sound strategies that typically improve UI scores, so the approach itself isn't flawed - the execution is.",
  "lessonsLearned": [
    "Implementation can fail silently - 0 files modified despite planning 5 changes indicates a breakdown in the implementation pipeline",
    "Score improvements without actual changes are unreliable and may indicate measurement errors",
    "Accessibility-focused improvements (contrast, focus indicators) are good targets but only if they're actually implemented",
    "We need better verification that changes are actually being applied to files"
  ],
  "suggestedNextSteps": [
    "Retry the same accessibility improvements but ensure implementation agents actually modify files",
    "Start with a single, simple change to verify the implementation pipeline is working",
    "Focus on high-impact, easily implementable changes like color contrast adjustments in CSS files",
    "Add explicit verification that file modifications are occurring before accepting score changes",
    "Consider targeting specific UI components or pages if the current context is too broad"
