# Worktree Experiment Archive

**Created:** 2025-10-08
**Deprecated:** 2025-10-08
**Status:** ‚ùå Discontinued

## What Was This?

During the E2E automation planning session on October 8, 2025, we explored using git worktrees for parallel development across 5 phases of the project. This included:

- **8 git worktrees** (main + 5 phases + testing + hotfix)
- **VS Code multi-root workspace** for unified development
- **Parallel development strategy** for faster iteration

---

## Why Was It Discontinued?

**Decision:** Keep VIZTRTR self-contained within a single directory

**Reasons:**
1. **Complexity overhead** - Managing 8 separate worktrees added operational complexity
2. **Disk space** - 3.4GB total for all worktrees (342MB each)
3. **Simpler alternatives** - Regular git branches work fine for phased development
4. **Self-contained preference** - Single project directory is easier to manage and deploy

---

## What Was Removed?

**Deleted on 2025-10-08:**
- 7 git worktrees (`VIZTRTR-phase1-scoring`, `VIZTRTR-phase2-agents`, etc.)
- 7 git branches (`phase1-scoring`, `phase2-agents`, `hotfix-env`, `testing-env`, etc.)
- VS Code workspace file (`viztrtr-e2e.code-workspace`)

**Archived Documentation:**
- `GIT_WORKTREE_STRATEGY.md` - Full worktree workflow guide
- `WORKTREE_QUICKSTART.md` - Quick reference
- `SESSION_2025_10_08_E2E_SETUP.md` - Session summary

---

## What Remains Valid?

The **E2E automation architecture plan** (`E2E_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md`) and **implementation roadmap** (`IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md`) remain valid and will be implemented using regular git branches instead of worktrees.

The multi-agent architecture, enhanced scoring system, and specialized agents are all still planned - just without the worktree infrastructure.

---

## For Future Reference

If parallel development across multiple phases is needed again, consider:

1. **Regular git branches** - Simpler, well-understood, works everywhere
2. **Feature flags** - Enable/disable features without branching
3. **Monorepo tools** (Nx, Turborepo) - If project grows to need workspace management

Worktrees are powerful but add complexity. Use only when truly necessary.
